##Installing the Arduino IDE

The Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a piece of software that is needed to "compile" the software and then upload it to the Arduino microcontroller chip.
The Raduino software (or "sketch") is written in C (a programming language). The program statements in the sketch must be "translated" to digital instruction codes that the Arduino microcontroller can understand and execute. This translation process is called "compiling".
